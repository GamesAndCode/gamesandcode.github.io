&lt;p>A space strategy, roguelike game. Lost in time and space, you travel to planets and stars to gather resources for your ship. Unfortunately, every journey costs you fuel and damages your ship. You must choose your path wisely to travel through space as long as you can. A updated version includes stuff, like different types of planets, obstacles and special events. A basic version of it can be played on &lt;a href="https://radiantdarkness.itch.io/space-exploration"
