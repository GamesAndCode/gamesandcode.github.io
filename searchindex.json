This time it was Devs That Jam, which is a 36 hour event. We actually won the jam!\nIf you are not familiar with game jams, here is a brief description:\nGame Jams are creative events where individuals or teams come together to design and develop a complete game in a limited timeframe. These events emphasize collaboration, innovation, and rapid prototyping, and often revolve around a specific theme or challenge. Participants bring diverse skills such as programming, design, art, and music to create unique and often experimental games.\nFor this game jam, I worked with two of my friends that I met at one of my previous game jams. Finn is a programmer in the same role as me. So we are working together to speed up the development time. Dirk is a music composer who has done some music for our past jams. His music is always on point and he proved it again this time. Below you can see a short gameplay clip of our submission:\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Game concept As always we started with some brainstorming. Finn and I gathered ideas about the game jam theme \u0026ldquo;60 seconds\u0026rdquo;. We basically took two approaches on game ideas. The first one would be a timeframe to solve a single task. If you do not fullfill it in time or make a mistake earlier, you lose. An example would be a bomb defusing game.\nThe second approach is about getting as many points as possible during the timeframe of 60seconds. In my opinion the second approach is often better, because it gives the game more replayability. Also in terms of a game jam, it gives the players the opportunity to compete with each other.\nBelow you can see our different type of ideas:\nAs you can see, we did not just start with our first idea. At the beginning we really liked the idea of making a fire in 60seconds. But in the end, it is important to compare some game mechanics, the time it takes to create them, and the resulting fun for the player. The first rule of a game jam is always to think small \u0026hellip; and then to make it even smaller. Also, we did not have an artist in our team, so we also had to keep in mind to choose a game idea that could be done with simple graphics.\nIn the end, we decided to go with the idea of destroying confidential data. The reason for this is the simplicity of the game mechanics required for this. Pick the data, destroy it and get points. All other features like different types of confidential data, combos or obstacles can be added on top of the already existing concept. When making games, you should always try to follow this principle. Even for bigger projects you want to publish.\nTo make this game fun, we wanted to stick to the theme and make it very hectic and chaotic. The idea of searching for confidential documents scattered around an office and then shredding them, seemed to fit that vibe.\nFirst day With the game idea in mind, we started writing a small game design document to get a better common understanding. After that we set up task for each other. We could reduce a lot of programming time using code from our previous projects. I encourage every developer to create a collection of small reusable code snippets (or use mine on this website ;). In particular we used a 3D player controller, a countdown system and a game starter kit of mine, which includes a user interface and a game, scene and audio manager.\nFor the rest of the day we implemented the basic game mechanics:\nPicking up objects Move objects to a shredder Drop objects Highscore system We managed to implemented this in about 6-8hours.\nSecond day After sleeping, we had about 16 hours to finish the project. We began by developing a tutorial scene to ensure players could easily grasp the game\u0026rsquo;s mechanics. Using the Polygon Office Asset Pack, we quickly populated our game with consistent, high-quality assets. We would have loved to have an artist on this project, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t have one, so we still tried to create a consistent look. Creating the map was our next step, focusing on an appealing and functional layout. The player should immediately understand what to do. Because of the silly and hectic style, we added rooms to the map for the player to explore. This would take time and create pressure to choose the right ones.\nAt this point we had sent some gameplay to our music composer Dirk. We also provided him with some reference tracks. He then created some great soundtracks to enhance the atmosphere of the game. The other sound effects were taken from https://freesound.org. Post processing added visual polish with lighting and color effects. After some playtesting we fixed some bugs and improved the game feel with some more visual and sound effects. We also tweaked the player controls a bit.\nIn the end we were running out of time, so we only had 2 hours left for our Itch.io page to showcase our game and share it with the community. I recommend doing this sooner than later, because it always takes longer than you think to create a game capsule, take some screenshots, etc. Remember, if your capsule and screenshots are not visually appealing, other players may not play your game! So take your time.\nResult In the end, we managed to win the game jam! My personal opinion for the good result is the overall impression of a finished game. The controls, the look, and the music have a lot to do with it. Even though we didn\u0026rsquo;t have time for more features in the end, the basic mechanic is fun and people actually played multiple rounds to improve their scores. Another reason might be that there were \u0026ldquo;only\u0026rdquo; 42 entries, which makes it easier to stand out. Still, there were some other great entries that I expected to have a chance to win.\nYou can take a look at the results for yourself:\nFeedback from 22 ratings: Play it here: Strictly confidential - itch.io.

This blog post describes my first steps to becoming self-employed.\nWhy am I doing this? I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about starting my own business for a long time. Especially on long evenings when I worked late into the night on games. Now I want to devote my full concentration to game development. Of course, personal freedom and other things that come with being self-employed are also important to me.\nFinances First of all, I have to rely on my own savings and grants. Within Germany, I have the opportunity to receive funding help from the state. I am currently going through a procedure to receive this start-up grant. This will enable me to finance my first game. There is also funding available within my federal state. I\u0026rsquo;m not quite ready to apply for it at the moment. However, this would also be an opportunity to obtain further funding. With external funding, I will be able to hire an artist, which I am currently looking for. Another source of income could be external services. For the time being, I\u0026rsquo;m ruling out a publisher or crowdfunding for my first game.\nStatus I am currently in the process of writing my business plan. This is not only important for the investors, but also for myself. I want to have a clear structure, goals and a clear timetable for them. If you are interested in the structure or the finished piece, please let me know.\nThere is no concrete game idea yet. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m analysing the games market for potential trends. Therefore I am currently using the Steam Next Fest.\nThe next step will be to set up a company. I\u0026rsquo;m also analysing the market and collecting game ideas.\nConcerns Alongside the confidence, there are also concerns. Above all, it\u0026rsquo;s about the visibility of the game. A game can be as good as it is, but without attention it is worthless. With the number of games being released on Steam these days, it is difficult to stand out. It\u0026rsquo;s important to have a good marketing strategy.\nAlso there will also be a lot of bureaucratic hurdles at the beginning. As a self-employed person, there are more obligations to fulfil. It will also be difficult to set the right priorities and not work too much. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to the challenge!\nWhat about you? Are you self-employed or have you ever thought about starting your own business? Tell me about your plans!\nFeel free to add your questions in the comments!

Advent calendar preview\nIntroduction Hello fellow game developers! This blog post will explain how to use an advent calendar template I created in unity. You can change the complete look of the calendar and create custom content for each day. All the assets I used are free (with attribution) and can be used by you. The resource code is available on github or as a Unity package in the code section.\nThis time I will not explain any code because I want to focus on the use of the advent calendar. Of course you can modify the code, but be aware that I built the advent calendar on top of a shop system. Therefore the code might be a bit over-engineered and sometimes a bit confusing. If you want to know more about the shop system I am building this project on, let me know so I can create a template and blog post for it.\nTemplate The image shows the advent calendar and the hierarchy of game objects:\nObject hierarchy and scene view in the unity editor\rThe basic functionality works as follows. When the date corresponds to the door number and you click on it, an image appears inside the door. This is the door picture. It will only appear once. The next time you play, it will already be there because you opened it. When you click on that door image, it opens up an user interface. You can basically put anything in there (text, images, videos, minigames etc.). In the example, I provide an user interface with some text and a link to an external website. The idea behind this is that you can upload some assets to your desired website and protect it with a password. The user will then get access to it when opening the door content.\nIf you want to change the look of your advent calendar, you should navigate to the Canvas. There you can change the background image, the images that appear inside each door (DoorPictures) or the door content itself. There is also a settings section that represents the user interface in the right corner. In the Music UI element, you will find a music track attached to the Music script, which you are free to change. There is also a snow particle effect that you can modify.\nIf you want to change things, I suggest to start with a new background image. After that you can rearrange the UI elements for the doors and the door picture themselves. Then create content for each door. In the doorContent section you will find 24 UI elements that are sequentially associated with each door. Of course, you can also leave everything as it is and just add content to the doors.\nThe doors, related pictures and UI content are connected inside the shop script that is attached to the calendar (left screenshot). They are attached sequentially, so you can identify the corresponding objects by their number (right screenshot). Make sure that all objects are not empty and attached to the shop script. Normally you do not need to change anything here and can just leave it as it is.\nScript on calendar connects the door elements\rNumbered doors and door pictures\rAdditional configurations can be made for each individual DoorPicture. As you can see in the image below, there are two scripts attached. In both scripts you can set some sound effects. The Appearing sound effect is played only when the door is clicked for the first time. The sounds in the UIImageHoverEffect script will be played every time the player hovers or clicks on the image.\nInspector view of a door picture element\rThe door content is a prefab and an example of how you could present your content. I suggest you create some prefab variants of it or just change the content for each door in the scene view. The DoorContentUI script has two optional input fields: \u0026lsquo;Download link\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Password\u0026rsquo;, as you can see in the inspector in the screenshot below. You can use these to redirect users to another page. There are also two drop-down menus in the inspector: \u0026lsquo;Ease In Type\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Ease Out Type\u0026rsquo;. These are the animation types from the LeanTween library that the game object uses when it opens and closes. Clicking outside the content interface closes it.\nAn example of the door content as user interface\rA very important configuration is on the door prefab! The TimeBasedButton script uses the current date to check if a door can be opened. In other words, if the button should be clickable. This script is attached to each button that is a child of the Door object (screenshot below). Here you can set the year and month you want to start the calendar. If you want to experiment with the mechanism, you can set the starting month to the current month in the door prefab. For your production build, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to change the starting year to 2023 and the starting month to 12.\nTime-based button that gets activated on the current date\rThe information about a door is already opened is saved in the PlayerPrefs. So if you are testing around and open some doors during play mode the state will be persisted. I created a script, so you can reset this in your editor. Therfore go to \u0026lsquo;Window/Clear PlayerPrefs\u0026rsquo;, as shown in the picture below. After that, you can open the doors again in game mode.\nReset the PlayerPrefs (opened doors)\rI will create an advent calendar with my own content and host it on my itch.io page. I am still looking for some assets to put behind the doors. So if you are an artist or any other kind of creator, I would love to work together! I hope you enjoy the template and the upcoming GameAndCode advent calendar.\nAnd now you!

Introduction One of the key elements that contributes to the interactivity of a game is the ability to seamlessly spawn objects into the game world. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s an enemy unit stepping out of the shadows, power-ups magically appearing, or obstacles falling from the sky, the art of spawning objects is a fundamental skill for game developers. In this blog post I will explain how to spawn an object at a random position on or off the screen in Unity2D. You can download the code on github or download a Unity package in the Code section to follow along. There is a class called Spawner that is associated with a game object in the scene. You can use it to play around with the different methods.\nRandom position offscreen When developing several 2D games, I always wondered about a good way to spawn objects out of the player\u0026rsquo;s view. Just using a fixed value from the player character did not seem right. What happens if someone plays the game on a different screen resolution? The objects will simply not spawn at the intended location. A better approach is to calculate the screen boundaries and use them as a reference. This can be done using the game camera. If the edges of the screen are known objects can be moved outwards with a distance determined by us.\nIn most cases Unity\u0026rsquo;s Main Camera is needed for this purpose. Unfortunately, the edges of the camera do not correspond to the coordinates in the scene. But they can easily be transformed into a scene position using the Camera.ScreenToWorldPoint method. The following code snippet demonstrates how to get the edges of our screen and the screen size.\nfloat cameraDistance = mainCamera.nearClipPlane; // Calculate the coordinates of the screen borders BottomLeft = mainCamera.ScreenToWorldPoint(new Vector3(0, 0, cameraDistance)); TopLeft = mainCamera.ScreenToWorldPoint(new Vector3(0, Screen.height, cameraDistance)); TopRight = mainCamera.ScreenToWorldPoint(new Vector3(Screen.width, Screen.height, cameraDistance)); BottomRight = mainCamera.ScreenToWorldPoint(new Vector3(Screen.width, 0, cameraDistance)); Width = BottomRight.x - BottomLeft.x; Height = TopLeft.y - BottomLeft.y; I have created public fields for the four corners, the height and width, which are set in this code block. You can find the code itself in the ScreenBorders class.\nWith this information, we can start calculating a random position on or off the screen. The basic idea is to use Unitys Random class to get a position on one of the screen borders and then move that point an additional distance. For example, if we want to spawn an object at the top of the screen, we can simply calculate a random x-position between the top edges. Then we take the y-variable of a top edge and add the distance we want the object to be outside of the screen:\nfloat x = Random.Range(screenBorder.topLeft.x, screenBorder.topRight.x); float y = screenBorder.topLeft.y + AdditionalDistance; AdditionalDistance is again a public field that I set above in my class. Using this approach, we can decide on which side of the screen to spawn the object. A method that takes the direction as a parameter and returns a random position might look like this:\nprivate Vector2 OutOfScreenDirection(ScreenDirection direction) { screenBorder.CalculateScreenBorders(); float x = Random.Range(screenBorder.BottomLeft.x - AdditionalDistance, screenBorder.BottomRight.x + AdditionalDistance); float y = Random.Range(screenBorder.BottomLeft.y - AdditionalDistance, screenBorder.TopLeft.y + AdditionalDistance); switch (direction) { case ScreenDirection.TOP: y = screenBorder.topLeft.y + AdditionalDistance; break; case ScreenDirection.BOTTOM: y = screenBorder.bottomLeft.y - AdditionalDistance; break; case ScreenDirection.LEFT: x = screenBorder.bottomLeft.x - AdditionalDistance; break; case ScreenDirection.RIGHT: x = screenBorder.bottomRight.x + AdditionalDistance; break; } return new Vector2(x, y); } You will find this method in the class called RandomPosition. The ScreenDirection parameter is a value from an Enum, that defines the direction. This method returns us the position, from a certain direction, outside the player\u0026rsquo;s view. In case we don\u0026rsquo;t care for which direction the random position is calculated, we can write an additional method:\npublic Vector2 OutOfScreen() { ScreenDirection[] directions = (ScreenDirection[])Enum.GetValues(typeof(ScreenDirection)); ScreenDirection randomDirection = directions[Random.Range(0, directions.Length)]; return OutOfScreenDirection(randomDirection); } To demonstrate the result I will use animations for the rest of this post. In the animations the presented methods are called very often in small intervals. At the random positions I get from this, I instantiate colored circles. In the following animation it can be observed which positions are covered by the method when it is called several times.\nRandom position off screen\rThe objects we spawn will all end up at the same distance out of the player\u0026rsquo;s view. A use case for this would be to spawn some enemies that move towards the player.\nIt may happen that you do not want to leave the spawn position entirely to chance. For example, it could be the case that spawn positions are only desired from the left and right. In this case we can write another method that leaves this decision to us.\npublic Vector2 OutOfScreenDirection(params ScreenDirection[] screenDirections) { ScreenDirection randomSpawnDirection = screenDirections[Random.Range(0, screenDirections.Length)]; return OutOfScreenDirection(randomSpawnDirection); } Instead of passing an array, I decided to use the params keyword. The params keyword allows us to add a variable number of arguments of type ScreenDirection. You can read more about this in the C# documentation. With that we can add multiple direction values as parameters and get a random position from one of them. For example if we are only interested in getting random positions from left and right, we simply pass ScreenDirection.LEFT and ScreenDirection.RIGHT as arguments to the method. You can see this example in the first image below. You can also use the method to influence the probability from which side the random position is more likely to be calculated by passing the same direction multiple times as an argument.\nUsing the method:\nSpawnOutOfScreen (ScreenDirection.LEFT, ScreenDirection.RIGHT)\rSpawnOutOfScreen (ScreenDirection.TOP) with a negative value\rYou may be wondering what is happening in the second image. By setting the AdditionalDistance variable to a negative value, I used the OutOfScreenDirection method to get a random position within the player\u0026rsquo;s view at the top position.\nBut before we go into more detail about onscreen spawning, I want to highlight the current approach we have chosen. The positions we get around the screen border will always have the same distance to the border. As a result, all possible random positions represent a rectangle. If we were to spawn multiple objects with a fixed movement speed at the same time, they would take the same amount of time to enter the player view. But what if we want to spawn objects outside the screen, but all at the same distance from the player?\nFor this approach, we assume that the player is in the center of the screen, as is most often the case in survivor rogue-like games. Using the distance to an edge of the screen as a radius, we can get random positions in a circular shape from the screen. For directions we use the Random class to get an angle corresponding to the direction. For example, the position to the right must be between an angle of -45 to 45. Following the same scheme as we did for the rectangle screen border, I created a new method in the RandomPosition class called private Vector2 OutOfScreenDirectionCircular(ScreenDirection direction). This method gives us a random position on a circular shape outside the screen. As before, we can specify the directions. The result will look like this:\nRandom position off screen circular\rUsing the method:\nOutOfScreenDirectionCircular (ScreenDirection.LEFT, ScreenDirection.RIGHT)\rTo make it as convenient as possible to switch between rectangle and circle positions, I created a public bool field Circular inside the RandomPosition class. Use this field to toggle between the two random position types.\nTo cover another use case, I created another public field called SinglePoint. If this field is set to True, then the methods already presented will return only one point from one direction at a time. To understand this better the two following graphics serve.\nRandom position off screen:\nSinglePoint = True;\nCircular = False;\rRandom position off screen:\nSinglePoint = True;\nCircular = True;\rAs you can see, the points are always located at half the height/width. If this function is still unclear, I suggest looking directly in the code. All in all, this was quite a lot of information at once. Use the Spawner class to play around with the different methods. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask them in the comments. The next chapter on onscreen spawning will be easier.\nRandom position on screen In the last chapter we already saw how to use a negative AdditonalDistance value to get a position inside the screen with the public Vector2 OutOfScreen() method. Getting a random position on the screen is quite simple compared to the previous methods. We just need to calculate a position between each screen boundary.\npublic Vector2 OnScreen() { screenBorder.CalculateScreenBorders(); return new Vector2(Random.Range(screenBorder.BottomLeft.x, screenBorder.BottomRight.x), Random.Range(screenBorder.BottomLeft.y, screenBorder.TopLeft.y)); } The simulation of this approach looks like this:\nRandom position on screen\rAnother common way to spawn objects is to spawn them around a target, for example the player. This can be especially helpful when, for example, enemies, spells, or special effects are supposed to appear near the player. Unity\u0026rsquo;s Random class has a method called insideUnitCircle, which returns a random point inside or on a circle with the radius of 1. We can use this method and multiply it with a desired radius. Also we have to add the position of the target.\npublic Vector2 AroundTargetInCircle(GameObject target, float radius) { return (Random.insideUnitCircle * radius) + (Vector2)target.transform.position; } If we want the random position to always have the same distance to the target, we just have to normalize the result of the Random.insideUnitCircle method. This way we always get a Vector2 with a magnitude of 1.\npublic Vector2 AroundTargetOnCircle(GameObject target, float radius) { return (Random.insideUnitCircle.normalized * radius) + (Vector2)target.transform.position; } Both options are shown in the following figures. The white box in the center of the screen symbolizes the target.\nRandom position around the target inside of the circle\rRandom position around the target on the circle\rIn our method AroundTargetInCircle it is possible that objects also appear on the target or directly next to it. However, this is not always intentional. For example, it makes no sense if an enemy spawns right next to the player and the player has no time to react. With a small adjustment in the code we can add a safety distance between the target and the spawn area. So besides the outer radius we need an inner radius that defines the safety distance. Because the spawnarea now looks like a donut, we also call the method after it:\npublic Vector2 AroundTargetInDonut(GameObject target, float innerRadius, float outerRadius) { Vector2 position = AroundTargetInCircle(target, outerRadius - innerRadius); Vector2 direction = (position - (Vector2)target.transform.position).normalized; return position + direction * innerRadius; } As you may have noticed, we use a little trick for this method. We first get a random point around the target, subtracting the safety distance from the radius. We add this safety distance back at the end. This creates an empty area around the target. An example can be seen in the following figure:\nRandom position around target with safety distance\rHaving the random position is a good start, but what now? There are several ways to spawn objects in Unity. The most basic way is to use the instantiate method. Depending on the game you are making, you may want to consider a different approach, such as an object pool.

Screenshots Bibliography Introduction Programming a game over a long period of time can be very exhausting. Many indie game developers give up their games during the development process. One reason might be, that the games are too big or too complex to be handled solo.\nGame Jams in contrast, give only a small time period to finish a game. The result might only be a low polished or unfinished game, but there is great potential. Firstly the Game jam forces to think small and not to waste time on every idea, that could be a nice feature. Second, game Jams are a great way to test and enhance your programming and game design skills. Programming is a path of consistent learning. Especially making video games reveals many new aspects to learn every time you do it. Working on a project for a long time sometimes makes you rewrite your initial code because your skills have been already improved again. In conclusion it is sometimes helpful to learn in a smaller project scope.\nTo do that I participated in the KenneyJam 2023. The Jam was 54 hours long and the theme was exploration. It was revealed at the start of the jam. An additional restriction was only to use assets from the organisers website (kenney.nl). In the following I would like to present the work process of the small space game I created during the jam. You can find my experiences and the full source code at the end of the post.\nGame concept At the start of the jam I first got an overview of the assets. I concluded that using space assets will give a lot of possibilities. Also they are fitting to the theme \u0026ldquo;Exploration\u0026rdquo;. After that, the most important part began. Developing a game idea and committing to it. The difficulty is to find a simple and fun concept that doesn\u0026rsquo;t take too much time to implement. In the book A Theory of Fun, by Raph Koster, it says that games need to train our brain to be fun. The fun comes from richly interpretable situations ([1] p.38).\nTo achieve this, I wanted to combine randomness and resource management. I decided to use two resources that the player would have to manage. Each move would cost a same amount of these resources every time the player moves. At the same time the player gains some resources back, depending on the path he chooses. To avoid boredom when playing the same map over and over again, the amount of resources is generated with a probability at the start of each game.\nThe game idea and the basic game mechanics were born. To reduce complexity I decided to make a 2D game. Next I made some drafts with pen and paper and resulted in a map of a hexagon grid. To prepare the code structure I made a small uml class diagram. The concept took me about 2hours.\nFirst day (Basic implementation) To generate a good looking hexagon map I followed a great tutorial by Game Dev Guide. In order to make this functional for my game, I made some adjustments to generate this for a 2D perspective. This took me some time but in the end I had access to the coordinates of each corner of a hexagon. It was time to use some of the Kenney assets and place them on the grid. So I combined some particle effects to create planets. The result looked like this:\nOn the first day I continued implementing the basic functions. To move the ship, the player has to click on of the neighbouring planets. I decided that every move would cost the player 10 fuel and 5 hull. If one of the resources would reach zero, the game would be over. Each planet will give the player some resources back. The stars have different probabilities to spawn, so that powerful resources are not that common. After adding a user interface, the resource amount was shown, when hovering over the stars. I also added a special star, of which the resources are not shown to the player. It gives either negative or positive stats, based on a coin flip. These risky options give the player the possibility to gamble.\nAt the end of day one the basic game mechanics were finished and the result can be seen in a Twitter post I made that day:\nI managed to create a simple space travel game for the #KenneyJam. Pretty optimistic about finishing it in time!#indiedev #madewithunity pic.twitter.com/9qS2dn8BJZ\n\u0026mdash; Radiant darkness (@RadiantDrk) July 21, 2023 Second day (Look and feel) The second day was about making a better user interface and making the game feel good. For the user interface (UI) I combined some code snippets I already had with game assets from Kenney. This created a spacey looking menu interface.\nThe game assets also include sound effects. I used some of them for the UI buttons and for the movement of the spaceship. I also found some really nice background music at https://opengameart.org/ that added a immersive feeling to the gameplay. For the background I used the unity particle system to spawn some star sprites in front of a background image. These things improved the look and feel.\nAfter playtesting and fixing some bugs, I realized that the gameplay was fun, but not exciting enough. I had a lot of ideas to spice things up, but the second day was almost over.\nTo get the player to play more than one round, I displayed the number of stars traveled, so there could be a personal highscore. To make the player feel even more rewarded, I had to add something else. I had the idea to show some visual effects every time the player reached a certain number of planets traveled. This was not very complicated and could be implemented quickly. I used some more space assets that would slowly fly across the screen after reaching a certain number of points. This ended the second day with a solid basic gameplay. I had a few more ideas, but I planned to use the third day to upload the game and create a nice looking game page on itch.io.\nThird day (Itch.io page and polish) On the third day, I had about eight hours before the deadline. I took my time for the game page and to check if my WebGL version was working correctly. When I finished, I realized that I still had some time left. My game architecture allowed me to implement one more feature without breaking the old stuff. So I added two more spaceships that the player could unlock by reaching a certain number of traveled planets. This gave the game an extra incentive to be played more often. And that was basically it. You can see the final result below.\nResult Game: Space exploration - itch.io. Source code: Github Feedback: Lessons learned Create a game idea that you can execute in the time allotted. It\u0026rsquo;s best to always plan for enough of a buffer. In the end, there is always something left to do. Limit the game idea to as few features as possible. You can always add some afterwards. Organize your tasks into a to-do list. Use pen and paper or online tools. Keep track of your tasks and prioritize them. For example, use Essential, Basic, Nice to Have. You can also estimate how long it will take you to complete each task. For non-essential tasks, it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes even better to set a time limit and keep going, even if you couldn\u0026rsquo;t quite complete the task. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to add you submission as an extra task. Take the time to make the game feel good. Especially the little things, like sound effects or fade animations already make a big difference. Pay attention to a clean control and avoid game-disrupting bugs. This may be obvious, but once you\u0026rsquo;re in the flow, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to forget to eat something nutritious. At least that was the case for me. Your brain needs a proper meal to function, so don\u0026rsquo;t just eat fast food. The same is true for sleep. It is counterproductive to do without sleep. Your brain works best when you\u0026rsquo;re well-rested. That way you solve problems much better. This is a general tip for programming. If your concentration is slipping or you are stuck on a problem, take a break and move around a bit. The Kenney Jam was optimal for programmers because no additional graphics could be used. For a game jam without this restriction, I recommend at least working with an artist. The collaboration is fun and gives the game a good overall look. Reuse your code! If you already have programming experience, reuse code from old projects. This will speed up the development process. Even if you are implementing a completely new game idea, you can use snippets, such as a game menu or a movement system, from old projects. You can also use my templates that I will provide on this website or on Git. Play a lot of the other submissions. Due to the fact that all participants have the same starting position, the different results are extremely interesting. When playing, pay attention to their game design and what game mechanics were used. Especially fun games are extremely valuable to improve your own understanding of game design. And now you!
