&lt;p>One of the key elements that contributes to the interactivity of a game is the ability to seamlessly spawn objects into the game world. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s an enemy unit stepping out of the shadows, power-ups magically appearing, or obstacles falling from the sky, the art of spawning objects is a fundamental skill for game developers.
In this blog post I will explain how to spawn an object at a random position on or off the screen in Unity2D. You can download the code on &lt;a href="https://github.com/GamesAndCode/RandomSpawnPosition"

&lt;p>Programming a game over a long period of time can be very exhausting. Many indie game developers give up their games during the development process. One reason might be, that the games are too big or too complex to be handled solo.&lt;br>
Game Jams in contrast, give only a small time period to finish a game. The result might only be a low polished or unfinished game, but there is great potential. Firstly the Game jam forces to think small and not to waste time on every idea, that could be a nice feature. Second, game Jams are a great way to test and enhance your programming and game design skills. Programming is a path of consistent learning. Especially making video games reveals many new aspects to learn every time you do it. Working on a project for a long time sometimes makes you rewrite your initial code because your skills have been already improved again. In conclusion it is sometimes helpful to learn in a smaller project scope.&lt;br>
To do that I participated in the KenneyJam 2023. The Jam was 54 hours long and the theme was exploration. It was revealed at the start of the jam. An additional restriction was only to use assets from the organisers website (&lt;a href="https://kenney.nl/"

>kenney.nl&lt;/a>). In the following I would like to present the work process of the small space game I created during the jam. You can find my experiences and the full source code at the end of the post.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
